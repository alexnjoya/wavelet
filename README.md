## Wavelet-Based Image Representation

Wavelet-based image representation is a powerful technique for analyzing and processing images at multiple resolutions. This repository demonstrates the use of wavelets for image compression, denoising, and feature extraction through practical examples and implementation.

# Features

Multi-Resolution Image Decomposition: Break images into approximation and detail coefficients.

Image Compression: Efficiently compress images using wavelet transforms.

Image Denoising: Suppress noise while preserving image details.

Edge Detection: Extract edges and localized features using wavelet sub-bands.

Visualization Tools: Visualize wavelet decomposition and reconstructed images.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

PyWavelets (for wavelet transforms)

NumPy (numerical computations)

Matplotlib (visualization)

OpenCV (image handling and processing)
